# TestRepo

This project was created as a part of Carleton Universitieâ€™s DIGH5000 Intro to Digital Humanities Class. We as a class were tasked with building a digital project, something to showcase our abilities and interests. We settled on building something that would make reference to the upcoming DH2020 conference to be held here in Ottawa, but more on that later. Our thoughts on the project took many forms:

We thought some sort of geotagged map showcasing research happening in Ottawa
We considered mapping digital humanities research trends in some way
We talked about building a virtual exhibit or a virtual space online that could be a venue for DH discussions
On the whole, however, none of these approaches felt compelling enough for us, so we turned to a digital method we all agreed was compelling and allowed for interpretation: topic modelling.

The format the project would take was not yet settled though, we had the task of determining what, exactly, we would topic model. We then had to gather data and run it through the topic modelling program itself. We had to have discussions about how we would want to go about presenting the data we gathered. Additionally, we were all fascinated by network analysis: a visual interpretation of the relationships between topics that were digitally generated from the data we gathered. All that to say, a lot of the project was still up in the air, but at that time we were confident it would settle on solid ground
